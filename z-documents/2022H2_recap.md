    - UI Modeling: 73% progress
    - Educate users on key actions: 30% progress
- **Some highlights**
    - Preview Markdown file
    - Refresh Modeling structure
    - Edit SQL model
    - A bunch of UX improvement

### Preview Reporting

- Goal
    - Allow users to test their modeling changes before deploying to Production
    - As part of our MSP, this feature is also a key component in the modeling journey
- Progress
    - ‚úÖ Done implementing (but wait for the AML Performance improvement)
- Demo
    - https://cdn.holistics.io/docs/v4/preview-reporting/demo-preview-reporting.mp4

- Goal: Provide a better experience for H4.0 users when using both UI View and Code view
    - No import statement
    - No `index.aml` file
    - Introduce Module concept
- Progress
    - ‚úÖ Done implementing
    - üõ†Ô∏è Migrating for current 4.0 users (4/15)

# 2022 Q4 plan

> **Narrative**: Ensure the seamless workflow for AE players to build the core foundation for self-service BI and adopt Engineering best practices

Based on all the interactions with 4.0 customers, we do notice that there is a need 

```
üí° Core focus: Launch H4.0 to do market validation + Support advanced modeling options as our competitve advance
